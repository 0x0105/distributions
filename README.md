# NodeSource Node.js Binary Distributions

![Linux Distributions](https://nodesource.com/assets/external/linux-distributions.svg)

This repository contains the source of the
**[NodeSource](https://nodesource.com)** **[Node.js](http://nodejs.org)** Binary Distributions setup scripts.

For Debian / Ubuntu based distributions, see the **[deb](./deb)** directory for the source of the two setup scripts located at <https://deb.nodesource.com/setup> and <https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_dev>.

For Enterprise Linux based distributions (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora), see the **[rpm](./rpm)** directory for the source of setup script located at <https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup>.

Please file an issue if you are experiencing a problem or would like to discuss something related to the distributions.

Pull requests are encouraged if you have changes you believe would improve the setup process or increase compatibility across Linux distributions.
